- react-scripts (4.0.3) throws a bug 
    => Before `npm install react-router-dom` change it to "react-scripts": "5.0.0" or "5.0.1" 
    This will update the react-scripts and everything will be wonderful 

- Don't forget to wrap the <App /> with the <Router /> 
    - (or BrowserRouter if you didn't change the name 

- Don't forget to add the "to" attribute to your links

- Route component receives a "path" attribute

- Be careful with the properties in the static ".json" / axios.get

- You need to destructure what you receive using useParams()

- On the useEffect() dependencies array you could add the id/code in the Details
    => so you the details updated after you click in another country
