- The instructions for this LAB are long
    - We'll be creating the components (maybe they will not work or you need to use placeholder values at first)
    - We'll be linking everything together on Iteration 2 and maybe you should change some of the placeholders and add props

- Don't forget to wrap the app component on the `index.js`
  <Router> 
    <App />
  <Router /> 
    - (or BrowserRouter if you didn't change the name)

- Have just one <Routes> <Routes /> component in the whole App 
    => Probably just on App.js

- Link or NavLink receive a "to=" attribute 

- Route component receives a "path=" attribute

- When you're putting everything together don't forget to add the bootstrap classes
    - I recommend using `<div className="container d-flex justify-content-between">` instead of just `<div className="container">`
        => That way you'll get the CountryDetails on the side of the CountryList component

- Be careful with the properties in the static ".json" / axios.get

- The useParams() hook gives you an object with the property name that you used on the dynamic route
    - console.log() to check what you're getting

- On the useEffect() dependencies array you could add the id/code in the CountryDetails
    => That way you'll have the details updated after you click in another country

- Integrating everything getting live info from the API
